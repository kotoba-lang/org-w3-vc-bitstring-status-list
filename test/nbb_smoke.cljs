;; nbb smoke test — proves the :cljs branch of this library is real.
;;
;; The JVM suite cannot cover it, and this library has already been bitten once by
;; exactly the divergence it is checking: `multiformats.core/base64url-decode`
;; returns a byte-array on :clj whose bytes are SIGNED, so the gzip magic 0x8b
;; arrived as -117 and a perfectly good member was rejected as "bad magic". On
;; :cljs it returns unsigned ints and the same code path was fine. A status list
;; that one host can write and the other cannot read is a revocation that silently
;; stops working.
;;
;; The encodedList is also a SIGNED value (it sits inside a
;; BitstringStatusListCredential), so a host that gzips differently produces a
;; credential the other host's verifier rejects.
