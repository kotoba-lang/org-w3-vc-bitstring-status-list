;; `kotoba/status_list/check.kotoba` against `status-list.core/check-status`.
;;
;; The slice is the decision: which bit answers the question, whether the
;; list may be asked at all, and what the bit means. The base64url, the
;; GZIP and the 16 KiB buffer stay in the host.
;;
;; So the two are handed the SAME entry and the SAME status list credential
;; — built by `status-list.core` itself — and compared on the status, the
;; validity and the reason for a refusal.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph).
;;
;; ## The host loop is the point
;;
;; `drive` expands the `encodedList` once, tells the guest only how many
;; BYTES it came to, and then hands over exactly the bytes the guest asks
;; for by index — `needs-byte-at`, one at a time. The guest never holds the
;; list; the host never learns which bit it is looking at or why.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;;   * `index-zero-is-the-left-most-bit` — §3.1. `core.cljc`'s own comment
;;     says what getting it backwards costs: a list that decodes without
;;     error and reports the WRONG credential as revoked. This checks the
;;     two ends of a byte against each other, which is the only way to tell
;;     MSB-first from LSB-first apart;
;;   * `a-short-list-is-refused-and-the-reason-is-privacy` — §3.2 step 8.
;;     The floor protects the holder, not the verifier: below it, fetching
;;     the list starts to identify whose credential is being checked;
;;   * `a-purpose-mismatch-is-refused` — §3.2 step 3, on both sides: the
;;     entry against the list, and the list against what the verifier
;;     actually asked;
;;   * `a-refused-check-is-not-valid` — the honest answer to "I could not
;;     determine this" is not "yes".
